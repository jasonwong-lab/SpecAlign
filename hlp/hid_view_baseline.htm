		<P>The baseline picking algorithm&nbsp;implements a&nbsp;restrained moving average, 
			where only values less than the local average intensity are added to the global 
			moving average.</P>
		<P>The local moving average is specified as 1/4 of the global moving average. The 
			dialog option allows selection for the size of the global moving average window 
			expressed as a percentage of the full range of the spectrum.
		</P>
		<P>The result of baseline line picking is displayed as a red curve, see below for 
			example.</P>
