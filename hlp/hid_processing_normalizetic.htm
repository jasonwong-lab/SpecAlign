		<P>
			This command&nbsp;is used to normalize all spectra such that they will 
			all&nbsp;share the same&nbsp;total ion current.</P>
		<P>Note that Total Ion Current (TIC) is a term used for mass spectrometry. The 
			normalization procedure works in the same way for other spectroscopy methods, 
			where it may be total&nbsp;absorbance or total signal, etc.</P>
		<P><STRONG>Normalization algorithm</STRONG></P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			Calculate the total signal for each spectrum.
			<LI>
			Calculate the average&nbsp;signal by dividing the total signal by the number of 
			data points in each spectrum.
			<LI>
			Calculate the average signal for all spectra using the averages from step 2.
			<LI>
			Calculate the normalization factor for each spectrum by dividing 
			the&nbsp;average signal for each spectrum by the average total signal.
			<LI>
				To complete the normalization, multiply each value in each spectrum by the 
				normalization factor.</LI></OL>
