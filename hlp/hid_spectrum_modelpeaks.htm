		<P>Use this command to use bring up a dialog (see below) which gives options 
			to&nbsp;modeled the peaks in all spectra based on the selected function using 
			the Levenberg-Marquart algorithm.</P>
		<P><IMG alt="Model dialog" src="Images/modelDlg.jpg"></P>
		<P>Peak modelling not only enables the areas of peaks to be accurately estimated, 
			but it also allows overlapping peaks to be resolves therefore giving more 
			accurate area measurements compared to integration of the area under the peak 
			curve. For more details about peak modelling refer to:</P>

		<P>Following modelling, the modelled peaks are displayed in dotted green (see 
			below) and the option will be available to export peak areas.</P>

		<P>Once the peaks have been modelled, it is possible to extract peak areas directly 
			through <EM>File-&gt; Export -&gt; Peak Area. </EM>An option will then be 
			available to select the region of the peak signal desired based on the peak 
			model (below).</P>
