		<P>
			This command&nbsp;is used to convert all spectra to relative intensity.</P>
		<P>This is done by scaling each spectrum such that the maximum value is 1 and the 
			minimum value is 0.</P>
		<P>This function is particularly useful for generating input for further analysis 
			by methods such as machine learning where input variables often need to be 
			ranged between 0 and 1.</P>
