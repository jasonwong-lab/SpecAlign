		<P>Gives three options to view the loaded spectra as:</P>
		<P><STRONG><A name="line">Line graph (default):</A></STRONG></P>
		<P>Each spectrum is displayed with its own axis as a line graph (see below).</P>

		<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
		<P><STRONG><A name="bar">Bar graph:</A></STRONG></P>
		<P>Same as line graph, but points are displayed as bars rather than joined by 
			lines. Note that when zoomed out, it looks similar to line graphs with the area 
			below the spectrum filled in.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P><STRONG><A name="stack">Stacked graph:</A></STRONG></P>
		<P>All spectra are displayed in one axis stacked on top of one another (see below). 
			When printing or copying to clipboard via the edit menu, the image is printed 
			or exported as a stacked graph.</P>
		<P>
			Note that in stacked mode, all commands such as peak picking&nbsp;are still 
			functional, but the result cannot be directly visualized until the viewing mode 
			is switched back to line or bar graph.</P>

		<P>All spectra are displayed in one axis&nbsp;overalpping one another (see below). 
			When printing or copying to clipboard via the edit menu, the image is printed 
			or exported as a stacked graph.</P>
		<P>
		Note that in&nbsp;overlap mode, all commands such as peak picking&nbsp;are 
		still functional, but the result cannot be directly visualized until the 
		viewing mode is switched back to line or bar graph.
