					(Spectrum menu)</B></P>
			<P>This command&nbsp;is used to merge any newly loaded spectra with an existing an 
				average spectrum. If no average spectrum exists, an average spectrum is 
				generated. An average spectrum if present and if it is shown, will appear 
				plotted in red and at the top of all spectra displayed and will also be 
				labelled as "Average".</P>
			<P><STRONG><A name="avgspec">What is an average spectrum?</A></STRONG></P>
			<P>An average spectrum is a spectrum generated from an average of a number of 
				spectra which share the same range in the x-axis.</P>
			<P>There are a number of uses for the average spectrum:</P>
			<OL>
				<LI>
				Used as a reference to align all spectra to.
				<LI>
					Used to visually compare large numbers of spectra that are from two classes or 
					more.</LI></OL>
			<P>An average spectrum can be <A href="hid_file_export.htm">exported</A> and <A href="hid_file_import.htm">
					imported</A> for use as reference to align new samples or for comparison 
				with another spectrum or average spectrum.</P>
			<P>Note that an average spectrum can also be imported as a normal spectrum. 
				Similarly, any spectrum can be use as a reference for alignment if it is loaded 
				as an average spectrum.</P>
