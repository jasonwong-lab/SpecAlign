		<P>
			This command&nbsp;allows the user to rapidly evaluate the quality of the 
			dataset by checking for spectra which may be of poor quality relative to others 
			within the dataset.</P>
		<P>
			Two metrics are used to evaluate each spectrum relative to other spectra.</P>
		<P>The first is&nbsp;the average Pearson's correlation coefficient of each spectrum 
			against all other spectra within the dataset. For this measurement, users have 
			the choice to compare each spectrum in separate segments. Furthermore, users 
			may also choose the range in which to compare spectra. The correlation 
			coefficient is&nbsp;effective in detecting spectra which are unlike others in 
			the dataset in terms of shape.</P>
		<P>
			The second metric for evaluating spectra quality within the dataset is the 
			normalization factor. This&nbsp;factor is essentially the scaling factor 
			calculated applied during a <A href="hid_processing_normalizetic.htm">total ion 
				current normalization process</A>. The normalization&nbsp;factor is 
			effective in detecting spectra&nbsp;that substantially vary in total ion 
			intensity relative to other spectra of the dataset.</P>
		<P>When the command is executed, users are first given the choice of an ,/z range 
			to correlate spectra and the number of segments to partition the spectra into 
			for correlation. Note that&nbsp;1 segment&nbsp;means that the whole spectrum is 
			correlated with others directly. Increasing the number of segments may be 
			useful if a spectrum is dominated by high intensity peaks in one region, with 
			lower intensity peaks exist in others regions of the spectrum.</P>
		<P><IMG alt="Evaluation dialog" src="Images/evalDlg.jpg"></P>
		<P>Following the "Evaluate dataset" dialog, users will then be prompted for a 
			location to save the results of the evaluation.</P>
		<P><IMG alt="Evaluate dataset file dialog" src="Images/evalDlg_file.jpg"></P>
		<P>The results will be output as a&nbsp;CSV file which may be viewed in spreadsheet 
			software such as Microsoft Excel(TM).</P>
		<P>The output file is divided into two sections, the first is a list of the two 
			metrics for each spectrum (below).</P>
