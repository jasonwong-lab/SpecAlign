SpecAlign v1.3 (10-Mar-08)
by Jason W. H. Wong, Cartwright Lab, PTCL, University of Oxford. 2005-08(c)

This command line version of specAlign uses the same source code as 
the Windows version. The functions of specAlign are implemented in 4 
separate excutables.

(1) specAlign-prepro implements much of the preprocessing methods that
    is avaliable in the Windows version, excluding the alignment
    methods.
    The order in which each preprocessing method is optimized in the
    sense that if a number of methods are specified in a single run,
    there will be minimal interferance between each preprocessing
    method. The order is as follows:
        Crop
        Normalize by TIC
        Scale to positive
        Scale spectra by a factor
        Bin spectra
        Subtract baseline
        Smoothing
        Covert to relative intensity
    If the default order of operations is undesirable, it can easily be
    overcome by running specAlign-prepro a number of times separately
    with different preprocessing options.

(2) specAlign-peakalign implements the alignment by peaks method.
(3) specAlign-PAFFT implements alignment by PAFFT.
(4) specAling-RAFFT implements alignment by RAFFT.
